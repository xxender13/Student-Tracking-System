# Student Tracking System

An IoT-based student tracking system designed to monitor student locations in real-time using RFID technology. This system provides a practical solution for tracking students within a specified area, such as a campus or school.

## Project Structure

- **Full Report.pdf**: Detailed project report describing the system design, implementation, and findings.
- **IDF262_s.docx**: Supporting document with additional information on the project.
- **IoT-based Student Tracking System in alliance with.pdf**: Research paper or document outlining the alliance and objectives of the tracking system.
- **conference.pdf**: A conference paper or presentation associated with the tracking system.
- **rfid_data.csv**: CSV file containing RFID data samples used in the tracking system.
- **rfid_data.txt**: Text file with additional RFID data for testing or analysis.
- **test.py**: Python script for testing RFID data processing.

## Features

- **Real-Time Tracking**: Monitors and logs student locations within the coverage area.
- **RFID Data Processing**: Uses RFID technology to track student entry and exit times.
- **Data Storage**: Logs tracking data for future analysis.

## Setup

1. Ensure all required dependencies are installed for the Python environment.
2. Place RFID data files (`rfid_data.csv` and `rfid_data.txt`) in the correct directory for access.
3. Run `test.py` to execute a test on the tracking data.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- Required Python libraries (listed in the project report or `test.py` file comments)

## Usage

1. Run the Python script:
   ```bash
   python test.py
